## Objective

In this course you will learn how to make state of the art AI Chatbots with `OP stack  (OpenAI + Pinecone)`<br>
[ChatGPT](https://openai.com/blog/chatgpt) is a new kind of `AI as a Service (AIaaS)` which is gaining significant traction. In the foreseeable future, only large corporations will be responsible for creating their own AI models, while smaller entities will rely on pre-trained, general-purpose models such as ChatGPT. As an AI developer and chatbot expert, I opine that while ChatGPT may not yet be at the peak of its potential, it is poised to make substantial progress in the near future.

This course will offer comprehensive insights not only on ChatGPT APIs but also provide guidance on how such new forms of AI can be utilized by application developers. With the ChatGPT gold rush already underway, the ultimate aim of this course is to equip participants with the necessary skills to become part of this technological revolution.

## Who Is This Course for?

This course is designed for aspiring AI developers and Chat-bot enthusiasts, and application developers who are eager to explore the world of `state-of-the-art AI Chat-bots`. Whether you are a seasoned programmer or just starting your journey into the realm of artificial intelligence, this comprehensive course will equip you with the necessary skills to become a part of the `technological revolution driven by AIaaS`.

**Just basic Programming knowledge is required in any language,** No prior experience with Python is required, as the course focuses on JavaScript, making it accessible to a wider audience. If you are intrigued by the potential of AI-powered Chat-bots and wish to `leverage pre-trained, general-purpose models` like ChatGPT to build innovative applications, this course will provide you with the knowledge and insights to do so effectively.

## Under Consideration:
#### 1. Dialogflow CX: Bot Building Basics
google qwiklab for Learning dialogflow cx https://www.cloudskillsboost.google/focuses/20841?parent=catalog

#### 2. ChatGPT Prompt Engineering for Developers

https://learn.deeplearning.ai/chatgpt-prompt-eng - this is a very good course, it teaches openai gpt-3.5 prompt concepts to get desired results efficiently, problem is this course use python and it doesnt match with my course that uses es6, so I will only select part of this course that doesnt have coding and teaches concepts only so that selection is remaining from my side.



## Not part of the course but still useful resource:
#### Dialogflow ES and CX book: 
https://www.amazon.com/Definitive-Guide-Conversational-Dialogflow-Google/dp/1484270134 - this book is not added in the course because it is written by a google employee and it is more or less same thing what they already have in official docs, official docs are getting updates but this book is not. another main reason of not adding this book in mainly cover Dialogflow ES (v2) and I am already expert of it so I can teach it more quickly if I teach on just my memory without book and I already have completed several sections with this approach, eventually I wanted to add dialogflow CX (v3) in my course and this book just gives brief overview that is not enough so I decided not to add this book in the first place.


#### Irfan Malik course:

https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLxf3-FrL8GzTIQpnY_UyzDX6JK0_Kbe_t - I was considering this playlist for my course but eventually I decided not to because this playlist is heavily based on python and python is not a good programming language for AI as a service in my opinion, however generative Ai (openai, bard and its underlying technology) and its related tool(embedding and vector database) concepts taught in this course are good. if you watch any of the concepts in this video you will have to put some extra efforts to code that concept in es6 by searching equivalent library in es6. another problem I found in this course that it teaches some concepts in very detail that is I think not mandatory and lead to confusion and overthinking such as diffusion and generator concepts. I think we are not supposed to learn things in that depth in Ai as a service domain, otherwise I was planning to add video that doesnt have coding in it but eventually decided not to.
